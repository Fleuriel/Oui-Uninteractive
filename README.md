# KNOWN BUGS
- Pause Menu textures and hitbox are 'off'
- If 2 enemies are in the same scene and are moving around (Roam state), there is a chance that they can collide with one another as their paths intersect one another
- Player bullets may occasionally get stuck/destroyed mid-air without visually colliding with other objects
- If bullets are shot in the same direction as player movement while the player is at max speed, bullets have the tendency to destroy each other when they collide with one another
- In some extreme edge cases, enemy may choose a node that is outside the "game map". As a result, they will get stuck on the outer walls as they can never reach the end node. During testing, the chance of this happening was extremely low, but not 0%.
- Game window viewport bug: 
    1) File is in wrong folder (e.g. font in texture folder)
    2) Application starts (fullscreen)
    3) Error message pops up
    4) Window loses focus
    5) After pressing 'Ok' and returning to the application window, the game window viewport gets messed up (Bug).
    6) Once another scene is loaded, this bug is gone.
- In general, coordinates may be off in some areas (e.g. mouse, font)
- If player presses/taps "RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON" quickly to shoot, the shooting is slightly faster than when pressing and holding "RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON".
